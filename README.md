### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Looks like you have landed on my GitHub profile. I am Brijesh [pronounced: bree-jaysh], a passionate software developer from India.

- ðŸ”­ Most of my time is spent building software backends for customers and other teams. 

- ðŸŒ± These days I am working with Go and the ecosystem around it. Cool things to learn on my bucket list include Flutter, Svelte and Rust.

- ðŸ’¬ I try to build a strategy and plan stuff out as much as possible. That said I am quite flexible: ask some of my colleagues and they should vouch.

- ðŸ“« In my pastime I enjoy listening to music (synth-wave, soundtracks and retro), podcasts and watching sitcoms. 

Feel free to ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/martiandrover) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brijesh-sahoo/) to talk about anything you think we might have in common!

**Things I have become familiar with over the years:** _JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Node.js, Python, Flask, FastAPI, Java, SQL, AWS services (too many to list), Spreadsheets (yep, they hold the world together when everything else fails)_
